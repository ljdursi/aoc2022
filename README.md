# Advent of Code 2022

I'm using year's AoC to practice using C++17/C++20 algorithms and ranges.  

I'm quite excited by the possibilities of [C++ Standard Lanague Parallelism](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-standard-c-with-gpus-using-stdpar/), and make effective use of that I need to start getting better at using `<algorithm>`, `<numeric>`, and `<ranges>`.

So to first order, my goal is to write as few explicit for loops as possible.
